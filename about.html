    <h1>What Are Fennec Foxes</h1>
   
    <p>Fennec Foxes are the smallest foxes in the world and have the largest ears of all vulpines. Their adorable ears radiate heat and help keep their small bodies cool. Their soft fur is coated with a wooly undercoat that insulates them during cold nights and protects them from the hot sun during the day.  </p>
